# Futurama

Futurama is a Clojure library that deeply integrates diverse async abstractions across the Clojure and JVM ecosystem with [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async).

It provides a unified interface for working with multiple async types:
- **core.async** channels
- **CompletableFuture** (Java)
- **Future** (Java)
- **Manifold Deferred**
- **IDeref** types (promises, delays, atoms, refs)

All these types can be consumed and composed using a consistent API, making it easy to work with heterogeneous async code.

## Features

- **Unified Async Operations**: Use `!<!` and `!<!!` to read from any async type with automatic exception handling
- **Async/Thread Macros**: Create async operations that return any supported async type via configurable factories
- **Cancellation Support**: Cancel async operations across all supported types with `async-cancel!` and check status with `async-cancelled?`
- **Collection Utilities**: `async-map`, `async-reduce`, `async-for`, `async-some`, `async-every?`, and more
- **Thread Pool Management**: Route work to appropriate pools (`:io`, `:compute`, `:mixed`) for optimal resource usage
- **Deep Nesting Support**: Automatically unwrap nested async values
- **Exception-as-Value**: Uncaught exceptions are returned as values and rethrown on read

## Quick Start

```clj
(ns user
  (:require [futurama.core :refer [async thread !<!! !<!]])
  (:import [java.util.concurrent CompletableFuture]))

;; Read from any async type
(defn fetch-data []
  (CompletableFuture/completedFuture {:status "ok"}))

(!<!! (fetch-data))
;;=> {:status "ok"}

;; Use inside async blocks
(async
  (let [result (!<! (fetch-data))]
    (println "Got:" result)))

;; Compose different async types
(async
  (let [cf-result (!<! (CompletableFuture/completedFuture 42))
        chan-result (!<! (async/go 10))
        fut-result (!<! (future (+ 1 2)))]
    (+ cf-result chan-result fut-result)))
;;=> returns async result with value 55
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Async Operations

```clj
(require '[futurama.core :refer [async thread async-for !<!! !<!]])
(require '[clojure.core.async :refer [timeout]])

;; Create an async operation (parks, doesn't block threads)
(def result
  (async
    (!<! (timeout 100))
    "completed"))

;; Block waiting for result
(!<!! result)
;;=> "completed"

;; Create a thread operation (runs on thread pool)
(def heavy-work
  (thread
    (Thread/sleep 100)
    (* 42 42)))

(!<!! heavy-work)
;;=> 1764
```

### Async For Comprehensions

```clj
;; Sequential evaluation (items processed one by one)
(!<!!
  (async-for
    [a (range 4)
     b (range 4)
     :let [c (+ a b)]
     :when (and (odd? a) (odd? b))]
    (!<! (timeout 50))
    [a b c (+ a b c)]))
;;=> [[1 1 2 4] [1 3 4 8] [3 1 4 8] [3 3 6 12]]
;;   Takes ~200ms (4 items Ã— 50ms each)

;; Concurrent evaluation (items processed in parallel)
(!<!!
  (async-for
    [a (range 4)
     b (range 4)
     :let [c (+ a b)]
     :when (and (odd? a) (odd? b))]
    (async
      (!<! (timeout 50))
      [a b c (+ a b c)])))
;;=> [[1 1 2 4] [1 3 4 8] [3 1 4 8] [3 3 6 12]]
;;   Takes ~50ms (all items processed concurrently)
```

### Cancellation

Futurama supports cancellation of async operations across all supported types. When an operation is cancelled, it receives a `CancellationException`.

```clj
(require '[futurama.core :refer [async async-cancel! async-cancelled?
                                 async-cancellable? thread]])

;; Cancel a long-running operation
(def work
  (async
    (loop [i 0]
      (when-not (async-cancelled?)
        (!<! (timeout 100))
        (println "Working..." i)
        (recur (inc i))))))

;; Check if it can be cancelled
(async-cancellable? work)
;;=> true

;; Cancel it
(async-cancel! work)

;; Check if it was cancelled
(async-cancelled? work)
;;=> true
```

#### Cooperative Cancellation

For best results, long-running operations should cooperatively check for cancellation:

```clj
(defn cancellable-work [items]
  (async
    (loop [remaining items
           results []]
      (if (or (empty? remaining) (async-cancelled?))
        results
        (let [item (first remaining)
              result (!<! (process-item item))]
          (recur (rest remaining) (conj results result)))))))
```

#### Parent-Child Cancellation

Child async operations automatically detect when their parent is cancelled:

```clj
(def parent
  (async
    (let [child1 (async
                   (loop []
                     (when-not (async-cancelled?)  ; Detects parent cancellation
                       (!<! (timeout 100))
                       (recur))))
          child2 (thread
                   (while (not (async-cancelled?))  ; Also detects parent cancellation
                     (Thread/sleep 100)))]
      (!<! child1)
      (!<! child2))))

;; Cancelling parent will cause children to detect cancellation
(async-cancel! parent)
```

### Working with Different Async Types

```clj
(require '[manifold.deferred :as d])
(require '[clojure.core.async :as a])

;; Mix and match async types freely
(async
  (let [from-future (!<! (future (+ 1 2)))
        from-deferred (!<! (d/success-deferred 10))
        from-channel (!<! (a/go 20))
        from-completable (!<! (CompletableFuture/completedFuture 30))]
    (+ from-future from-deferred from-channel from-completable)))
;;=> returns async result with value 63
```

### Thread Pool Management

Route work to appropriate thread pools for optimal performance:

```clj
;; Use :io pool for I/O-bound work (default for async)
(async :io
  (!<! (http-request "https://example.com")))

;; Use :compute pool for CPU-intensive work
(async :compute
  (compute-fibonacci 1000))

;; Use :mixed pool for mixed workloads (default for thread)
(thread :mixed
  (do-some-work))

;; Bind a custom pool temporarily
(require '[futurama.core :refer [with-pool]])
(require '[java.util.concurrent Executors])

(def my-pool (Executors/newFixedThreadPool 4))

(with-pool my-pool
  (async
    (println "Running on custom pool")))
```

### Collection Utilities

```clj
(require '[futurama.core :refer [async-map async-reduce async-some async-every?]])

;; async-map: Apply async function to collections
(!<!!
  (async-map
    (fn [x] (async (!<! (timeout 50)) (* x 2)))
    (range 5)))
;;=> [0 2 4 6 8]

;; async-reduce: Reduce with async operations
(!<!!
  (async-reduce
    (fn [acc x] (async (+ acc x)))
    0
    (range 10)))
;;=> 45

;; async-some: Find first truthy result
(!<!!
  (async-some
    (fn [x]
      (async
        (!<! (timeout 50))
        (when (> x 5) x)))
    (range 10)))
;;=> 6

;; async-every?: Check if all satisfy predicate
(!<!!
  (async-every?
    (fn [x]
      (async
        (!<! (timeout 50))
        (< x 10)))
    (range 5)))
;;=> true
```

### Configuring Async Factories

Control what type of async result is returned:

```clj
(require '[futurama.core :refer [set-async-factory! set-thread-factory!
                                 async-future-factory async-channel-factory
                                 async-promise-factory async-deferred-factory]])

;; Use CompletableFuture for async operations
(set-async-factory! async-future-factory)

(type (async "hello"))
;;=> java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture

;; Use Manifold Deferred
(set-async-factory! async-deferred-factory)

(type (async "hello"))
;;=> manifold.deferred.Deferred

;; Reset to default (core.async promise-chan)
(set-async-factory! nil)
```

See the [tests](test/futurama/core_test.clj) for more examples.

| `<!` | Read from async value without throwing exceptions (returns exception as value) |
| `<!!` | Blocking read without throwing exceptions (returns exception as value) |
| `<!*` | Read from collection of async values without throwing exceptions |

### Async Creation

| Macro/Function | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `async` | Create async operation that parks instead of blocking (like `go`) |
| `thread` | Create async operation that runs on thread pool |
| `async?` | Check if value is an async type |
| `async-completed?` | Check if async operation has completed |

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `async-cancel!` | Cancel an async operation |
| `async-cancelled?` | Check if operation is cancelled (also checks parent operations) |
| `async-cancellable?` | Check if value can be cancelled |

### Collection Operations

| `async->>` | Thread-last with async operations |

### Thread Pool Management

| Function/Macro | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `with-pool` | Execute body with specified thread pool |
| `get-pool` | Get thread pool for workload type (`:io`, `:compute`, `:mixed`) |

### Factory Configuration

| Function | Description |

| `async-deferred-factory` | Creates Manifold Deferred |

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Thread Pools

Configure application-wide thread pools using the Java system property `futurama.executor-factory`:

```clojure
;; Use core.async's thread pool
(System/setProperty "futurama.executor-factory"
                    "clojure.core.async.impl.dispatch/executor-for")
```

The factory function receives a keyword (`:io`, `:compute`, `:mixed`) and should return an `ExecutorService` or `nil` to use defaults.

### Exception Handling

Futurama treats exceptions as values. Uncaught exceptions are:
1. Captured and returned over the async channel/future
2. Re-thrown when read via `!<!` or `!<!!`
3. Wrapped/unwrapped automatically (`ExecutionException`, `CompletionException`)

When operations are cancelled, they receive a `CancellationException`:

```clojure
(let [work (async
             (loop []
               (when-not (async-cancelled?)
                 (!<! (timeout 100))
                 (recur))))]
  (async-cancel! work)
  (try
    (!<!! work)
    (catch CancellationException e
      (println "Operation was cancelled"))))
```
